# Spring Boot HDFS Demo

This module serves as a demo for a simple Spring Boot application
with HDFS. After running the application,
the Swagger UI can be found at http://localhost:8716/swagger-ui/index.html.

This application assumes that the HDFS root path is `${hdfs.root}`, which 
is `hdfs://master:8020` by default.
